Open-source tune index and search engine with web interface

IN DEVELOPMENT

NOT STABLE

NOT FINISHED

This system is an open-source tune index and search engine.

 * The indexer has been programmed based on a program that appeared in the StackOverflow forum [1]. There is a lot of work to do in order to improve this.

 * The search engine has been programmed using Python programming language and as a CGi program. It has been tested using Python version 2.7.3.

 * The interface is based on a javascript piano [2] by Michael Morris-Pearce.
